<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A priority queue is a fundamental abstract data type that supports two operations: <span><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Insert</span></span>(k) and <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Extract-Max</span></span>. Priority queues have many practical applications, especially in areas such as scheduling and event driven simulations. Some examples of applications of priority queues in distributed environments appear in <span class="citation">[1]</span>. One example where there are multiple inserters, but only a single extractor, is the priority queue for a shared printer.</p>
<p>Efforts to build faster computers have shifted towards increasing the number of cores on a single computer. As a result, scalable and highly concurrent data structures in the asynchronous shared memory model are becoming increasingly important. In this model, each process can take an arbitrary amount of time between steps and may crash. Processes communicate by reading from and writing to shared registers, and by accessing LL/SC objects. If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">LL</span>/<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SC</span></span> object, then <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">LL</span>\((x)\) reads <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SC</span>\((x, v)\)</span> by process <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> writes <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has not been written to by an <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SC</span></span> operation since the last time <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> performed <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">LL</span>\((x)\)</span>. If <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SC</span>\((x, v)\)</span> writes <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> then it returns <span><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">True</span></span>. Otherwise it returns <span><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">False</span></span>.</p>
<p>Lock-freedom is a property that guarantees that, while operations are in progress and processes take steps, some operation will finish within a finite number of steps. Wait-freedom is a stronger property that guarantees that every operation performed by a non-faulty process finishes within a finite number of steps by that process.</p>
<p>Israeli and Rappoport <span class="citation">[2]</span> present a lock-free priority queue based on a heap, using LL/SC variables, with <span class="math inline">\(O(n\log{m})\)</span> amortized step complexity for both <span><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Insert</span></span> and <span><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Extract-Max</span></span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of processes and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the maximum number of elements in the priority queue during the operation. They outline how to extend it to a wait-free implementation using 2-word LL/SC, but with step complexity. This is the best wait-free implementation known.</p>
<p>In 2005, Jayanti and Petrovic <span class="citation">[3]</span> showed how to implement single-dequeuer queues with step complexity <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(\log{}n)\)</span> for both <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Enqueue</span></span> and <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dequeue</span></span>.</p>
<p>Inspired by this queue implementation, we consider a priority queue where only one process is allowed to perform <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Extract-Max</span></span>. Our single-extractor priority queue implementation uses single word <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">LL</span></span>/<span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SC</span></span> objects. It is wait-free and has step complexity for both <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Insert</span></span> and <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Extract-Max</span></span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of inserters and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the maximum number of elements in the priority queue during the operation.</p>
<p>Our implementation uses a single-inserter single-deleter (SISD) ordered multiset, which supports insertion (<span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SISD-Insert</span></span>) and deletion (<span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SISD-Delete</span></span>) with <span class="math inline">\(O(\log{r})\)</span> step complexity, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the maximum number of elements in the multiset during the operation. Finding the maximum element (<span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SISD-FindMax</span></span>) can be done with constant step complexity. Both the inserter and the deleter can perform <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SISD-FindMax</span></span>.</p>
<h2 id="the-construction">The Construction</h2>
<p>Suppose, for simplicity, that the number of inserters, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, is a power of 2. Our single-extractor priority queue implementation uses a complete binary tree with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> leaves. Each leaf corresponds to one inserting process. At each leaf, there is a single-inserter single-deleter (SISD) ordered multiset. Each internal node stores the largest key in its subtree as well as the index of the leaf that the key came from. An <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Insert</span></span> operation first inserts into its own SISD multiset and then helps propagate the largest key up the complete binary tree. An <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Extract-Max</span></span> operation reads the largest key from the root of the binary tree, deletes it from the SISD multiset of the appropriate leaf, and propagates the new maximum up the binary tree. We use an SISD multiset rather than an SISD priority queue because, by the time an <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Extract-Max</span></span> tries to delete a key from the SISD multiset of a leaf, it might no longer be the largest key in the leaf. Our single-extractor priority queue implementation is wait-free, and has step complexity for both <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Insert</span></span> and <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Extract-Max</span></span>, in addition to the time it takes to perform the SISD multiset insert and delete operations. Note that any process can perform <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Insert</span></span> as long as there is some way of guaranteeing that two or more <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Insert</span></span> operations are not performed concurrently. The SISD multiset is implemented using a persistent AVL tree. Each process announces the operation it wishes to perform, and the processes alternate between helping each other when there is contention. We use a novel adaptation of handshaking to ensure all operations are performed without duplication. The step complexity of insertion and deletion is <span class="math inline">\(O(\log{r})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the maximum size of the multiset during the operation, while finding the maximum element can be implemented in constant time.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>It would be interesting to obtain either a <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(\log{n} + \log{m})\)</span> lower bound or a faster implmentation of <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Insert</span></span> or <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Extract-Max</span></span>. Improvements to the step complexities of <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SISD-Insert</span></span> or <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SISD-Delete</span></span> will reduce the <span class="math inline">\(\log{}m\)</span> term in the step complexities of <span class="math inline"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Insert</span></span> or <span class="math inline">Extract-Max</span>, respectively.</p>
